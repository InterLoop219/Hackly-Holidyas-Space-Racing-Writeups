Flag 1 [50 points]:
    Identify yourself

Desription:
    Open the flag designer and see if you can hack your way into the admin base.
    Note: Only the URL https://portal.hackazon.org/flagdesigner and its sub-URLs are part of the teaser challenge.


Solution:
    So I opened the link and I saw flag generator. After a little invistegation with Firefox developer tools in network tab I saw that after each button a GET request is 
    made.
    ``` https://portal.hackazon.org/flagdesigner/api/flag/6/8/10/3/5/3/5/5.svg```

    We can assume that api have all possible flags and numbers after /flag folder is nubers of overlays and colors.
    After trying to make flag looks like an admin flag we can see that there is no overlay #1 that looks like in admin flag. 
    For overlay #1 is responsible second digit. There is 14 different overlays #1. Let's try to get 15.
    ``` /flagdesigner/api/flag/7/15/9/5/2/4/3/1.svg ```

    We get it. Flag is in image.
